4WD4WS Rover Simulation (MATLAB, PTC)
This project simulates a 4-Wheel Drive, 4-Wheel Steering (4WD4WS) rover in MATLAB, using a Path Tracking Controller (PTC) for trajectory following.
The simulation demonstrates advanced maneuvering capabilities including sharp turns and lateral movement using a realistic rover kinematic model.

🧠 Key Features
🔁 4WD4WS Kinematics: Simulates independent steering and drive for all four wheels.

🧭 PTC (Path Tracking Controller): Ensures accurate tracking of a predefined path using kinematic feedback.

📐 Zero Turning Radius: Enables holonomic-like maneuverability.

📊 Trajectory Visualization: Real-time plotting of actual vs desired path.

🛠️ Tools Used
MATLAB (R2021a or later recommended)

MATLAB’s plotting and simulation capabilities (no external toolboxes required)

🚀 How to Run
Open main.m in MATLAB.
